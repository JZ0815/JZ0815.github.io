## Leveraging Kafka Streams to Efficiently Handle Trades


### Introduction:

In the ever-evolving landscape of financial technology, the efficient handling of trades is paramount. Kafka Streams, a powerful library for building real-time data processing applications, offers a robust solution for processing and analyzing trade data seamlessly. In this tutorial, we will explore the step-by-step implementation of a Kafka Streams application to handle trades effectively.

### Prerequisites:

Before diving into the implementation, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

Apache Kafka installed and running.
Basic understanding of Kafka concepts (topics, producers, consumers).
Java development environment set up.
#### Step 1: Define the Trade Data Schema

Start by defining the schema for your trade data. Consider essential attributes such as trade ID, symbol, quantity, price, and timestamp. Normally we get those trades using FIX format. FIX 4.4 is widely used. 
A sample FIX message is like below.
```
8=FIX.4.4|35=D|34=1|49=SenderCompID|56=TargetCompID|11=ClOrdID123|54=1|55=AAPL|38=100|44=150.25|60=20231125-12:30:00|10=127|
```

In this example:

8=FIX.4.4 indicates the FIX version.
35=D indicates that it's a New Order - Single message.
34=1 is the message sequence number.
49=SenderCompID is the identifier of the sender's trading system.
56=TargetCompID is the identifier of the target's trading system.
11=ClOrdID123 is a unique identifier for the new order.
54=1 indicates a buy order.
55=AAPL is the symbol for Apple Inc.
38=100 is the order quantity.
44=150.25 is the order price.
60=20231125-12:30:00 is the time the order was created.
10=127 is the checksum.

Ensure consistency in data types to facilitate smooth processing within Kafka Streams.  We can convert and define our schema in Kafka as protobuf.
```
// trade.proto

syntax = "proto3";

message Trade {
  string tradeId = 1;
  String senderCompId = 2;
  String targetCompId = 3;
  string symbol = 4;
  int32 quantity = 5;
  double price = 6;
  int64 timestamp = 7;
}


```
Compile the Protobuf schema using the protoc compiler.

####Step 2: Create Kafka Topics

Set up Kafka topics for both trade input and processed output. Use the Kafka command line tools to create these topics, ensuring that they align with the defined schema.

bash
Copy code
bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic trades-input --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1
bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic trades-output --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1

Set up Kafka topics for both trade input and processed output using Avro as the serialization format. If you're using Confluent, leverage the Schema Registry to manage Avro schemas.

Step 3: Implement the Kafka Streams Application

Create a Java project and add the necessary dependencies for Kafka Streams. Implement the Kafka Streams application by defining a topology that processes trade data. Utilize features like filtering, aggregation, and windowing as needed.

Sample Code
```java
// YourTradeProcessor.java

public class YourTradeProcessor {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Properties props = new Properties();
        props.put(StreamsConfig.APPLICATION_ID_CONFIG, "trade-processor");
        props.put(StreamsConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "localhost:9092");

        StreamsBuilder builder = new StreamsBuilder();

        KStream<String, Trade> trades = builder.stream(
                "trades-input",
                Consumed.with(Serdes.String(), ProtobufSerdeFactory.tradeSerde())
        );

        // Perform necessary transformations and aggregations
        // Example: trades.filter(...).groupBy(...).windowedBy(...).aggregate(...)

        trades.to(
                "trades-output",
                Produced.with(Serdes.String(), ConfluentSerdeFactory.tradeSerde())
        );

        KafkaStreams streams = new KafkaStreams(builder.build(), props);
        streams.start();

        // Add shutdown hook to gracefully close the streams application
        Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(new Thread(streams::close));
    }
}

```


### Introduction to Kafka Streams Windowing

Kafka Streams introduces the concept of windowing to enable time-based processing of data streams. Windowing is a fundamental feature that allows developers to analyze and aggregate data over specific time intervals, providing insights into temporal patterns within the stream.


#### Time Windows:

Kafka Streams supports various types of time windows, such as tumbling windows, hopping windows, and sliding windows. These windows define how the stream is divided and processed over time.
Tumbling Windows:

#### Tumbling windows represent fixed, non-overlapping time intervals. All events within a specific window are processed together, providing a clear, non-overlapping view of data within each time frame.
Hopping Windows:

#### Hopping windows are similar to tumbling windows but allow for overlap. Events can belong to multiple windows, enabling more flexible analysis of data that spans multiple time intervals.
Sliding Windows:

#### Sliding windows offer a compromise between tumbling and hopping windows by allowing a specified amount of overlap between consecutive windows. This flexibility is useful for scenarios where continuous insights into evolving patterns are crucial.
Use Cases:

#### Real-time Aggregation:

Windowing is instrumental for real-time aggregation of data. It enables the calculation of metrics, such as counts, sums, or averages, over specific time intervals, providing a dynamic and continuously updated view of streaming data.
Temporal Pattern Analysis:

Windowing facilitates the identification and analysis of temporal patterns within data streams. This is especially valuable in applications where understanding trends and variations over time is essential.
Event Time Processing:

Kafka Streams windowing is designed to accommodate event time processing, ensuring that data is analyzed based on the time at which events occur rather than when they are processed. This feature is critical for applications that require accurate temporal analysis in the presence of delayed or out-of-order events.
Example:

Consider a streaming application that processes stock trade events. By applying windowing, the application can calculate the average trade volume every minute, providing insights into short-term trading trends. This real-time aggregation over time windows enables timely decision-making in financial scenarios.


#### Step 4: Test the Application

Generate sample trade data and produce it to the input topic using a Kafka producer. Observe the real-time processing of trades as the Kafka Streams application runs. Monitor the output topic to ensure that the trades are processed as expected.

#### Step 5: Scaling and Optimization

Explore opportunities for scaling your Kafka Streams application based on the volume of trade data. Consider partitioning strategies, optimization techniques, and deployment configurations to ensure the application's efficiency and resilience.


### Differences between Kafka Streams and Other Frameworks

In the following analysis, I will delve into the distinctions between Kafka Streams and other frameworks in four aspects: application deployment, upstream and downstream data sources, coordination methods, and semantic guarantees.

#### Application Deployment:

Starting with the deployment of streaming applications, Kafka Streams stands out due to its developer-centric approach. Developers are responsible for packaging and deploying Kafka Streams applications, whether as standalone JAR files or embedded within other Java applications. This approach grants flexibility but requires developers to manage the application lifecycle independently.

In contrast, other streaming platforms, such as Apache Flink, offer comprehensive deployment solutions. Taking Apache Flink as an example, streaming applications are modeled as individual logical computations encapsulated within Flink jobs. The framework autonomously manages the lifecycle of these jobs, including deployment and updates, without requiring developer intervention. Additionally, frameworks like Flink incorporate a Resource Manager role, handling all necessary resources for a job, and support various resource managers like YARN, Kubernetes, and Mesos.

This stands in contrast to Kafka Streams, which tends to delegate deployment responsibilities to developers rather than implementing a self-sufficient framework.

#### Upstream and Downstream Data Sources:

Moving on to differences in connecting to upstream and downstream data sources, Kafka Streams currently supports reading and writing data exclusively from and to Kafka. Without the support of Kafka Connect components, Kafka Streams is limited to interacting with Kafka topics. Conversely, other streaming frameworks often offer broader connectivity options.

For example, Flink, Spark, and Storm provide more versatile connectors, allowing data ingestion and emission from various sources and sinks beyond just Kafka. This expanded connectivity enhances the adaptability of these frameworks to diverse data ecosystems.

These disparities highlight that Kafka Streams, in its current state, may be more specialized in Kafka-centric scenarios, while alternative frameworks offer greater flexibility in data source interactions.

In summary, when considering application deployment and data source connectivity, Kafka Streams leans towards a developer-centric and Kafka-centric approach, while other streaming frameworks provide more comprehensive, framework-managed solutions with broader connectivity options.
